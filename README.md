What I love:
- Turning data into insights using practical ML and analytics
- Designing backend systems and APIs
- Learning new tools in cloud, DevOps, and MLOps

## Selected projects
Below are a few places to start — pin projects in your profile or link specific repos here.

- Project A — short 1‑line description of what it does and the tech used.  
- Project B — one sentence describing the goal and outcome.  
- Project C — prototype or demo with a link and short summary.

Tip: Replace the placeholders above with direct repo links and a short one-line outcome (e.g., “reduced latency by 30%”, “classifies X with Y% accuracy”).

## How to use this README
- Replace project placeholders with actual repo links and short outcomes.  
- Keep the "What I build" section focused on outcomes (what you solve) rather than tools.  
- Pin 3–6 most relevant repositories in your GitHub profile for easy discoverability.

If you'd like, I can:
- Fill the "Selected projects" section with real repo links and concise descriptions (I can fetch repo info if you want me to), or
- Produce a shorter "resume-style" README for recruiters, or
- Generate social media banner text and suggestions for profile pictures.

Let's pick one and I’ll update the README accordingly.
