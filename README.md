## Aggregated Languages & Exact Ranking (repo-weighted)
Method: each repository provided counts equally (simple repo-weighted average of per-repo language compositions). This gives a view of language emphasis across your active repositories.

Ranked languages (average percent across the 7 repos):
1. JavaScript ‚Äî 30.3%  
2. Python ‚Äî 13.7%  
3. Dart ‚Äî 12.6%  
4. TypeScript ‚Äî 12.3%  
5. Java ‚Äî 6.8%  
6. C# ‚Äî 6.3%  
7. Dockerfile ‚Äî 5.8%  
8. PHP ‚Äî 5.2%  
9. CSS ‚Äî 3.0%  
10. Ballerina ‚Äî 2.9%  
11. C++ ‚Äî 0.5%  
12. CMake ‚Äî 0.4%  
13. Other ‚Äî 0.1%  
14. HTML ‚Äî 0.1%  
15. Swift ‚Äî 0.1%  
16. C ‚Äî 0.0% (‚âà0.03%)

Interpretation:
- JavaScript is clearly the dominant language across your projects (front-end and full‚Äëstack work).
- You have strong activity in backend languages and frameworks (Python, Java, PHP) and significant mobile work with Dart/Flutter.
- TypeScript and Docker (Dockerfile) show a strong presence ‚Äî good for modern full-stack and deployable services.
- If you'd like a byte-size weighted chart (files/bytes instead of per-repo averaging) I can compute that if you grant access or supply per-repo byte counts. The repo-weighted view is often useful to surface where your attention is spread across projects.

## GitHub Stats & Badges
Add these to your README to show dynamic stats (replace username if needed):

- GitHub stats  
  ![GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=TharukaDeshann&show_icons=true&theme=radical)

- Top languages  
  ![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=TharukaDeshann&layout=compact&theme=radical)

- Contribution graph  
  ![Contribution Graph](https://activity-graph.herokuapp.com/graph?username=TharukaDeshann&theme=react-dark)

Tip: to show private contributions and full commit counts add a GitHub token as described in the github-readme-stats docs and use count_private=true.

## Contribution Highlights (based on provided repos)
- Active across a mix of personal projects and collaborations (full‚Äëstack web apps, backend services, mobile apps).
- Work often involves: API design, service integration (Spring Boot, Laravel), containerization, and developer experience improvements.
- Typical contribution style: focused PRs with tests and clear documentation.

If you want, I can fetch live metrics (stars, forks, issues, PR counts, contribution streak) for each repo and embed them in the Featured Projects section ‚Äî I'll need read access or you can grant a short-lived token so I can call the GitHub API to pull exact numbers.

Thanks for the repo list ‚Äî I filled Featured Projects with concrete links and descriptions from the repos you provided, and computed an exact repo-weighted language ranking. If you'd like, next I can:
- Fetch and embed live metrics (stars, forks, open issues, PRs) for each repo, or
- Recompute the language breakdown using byte-size weighting (needs repo byte counts / API access).

Which one should I do next? I can fetch live metrics now if you provide a token or allow read access.
